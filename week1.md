Assignment: April 30

# Labour Law
* To whom does labour law apply
    * Employed Workers
    * NOT Unemployed Workers
    * NOT Contract Workers
* Employed Workers have labour rights inherently
    * Contract of employment
    * Carries with it inherent employee rights
* Contractors and that nightmare
    * Contractors are independent and $\therefore$ not necessarily protected
    * Many rights are negotiated per-contract
    * Favoured in modern day (gig-economy, outsourcing)
* Workers may be employed, unemployed or contract workers
* Drafted by ILO in part
    * International Labour Organization
    * Tripartite group that makes some decisions on labour law

## Vicarious Responsibility
* Who is responsible for harm caused by an agent of an employer
* Relies on what counts as acting as an agent of another entity
* Employer may be responsible for the actions of their agents
* Contract workers depend on contract

## Floor of Rights
* Basic, immutable rights
* Cannot be signed away

## Employee rights
1. Individual rights e.g.
    * Unfair Dismissal
2. Collective rights
3. Anti-discrimination rights
4. Social security rights

# Scenario 1
* A student charged with possession of drugs
    * Does not disclose charge when applying for a job
    * Are they obligated to state this?
* Receives a 3-year fixed term contract
    * Placed on 6 month probation
    * Is this lawful?
    * Is this fair?
* What is the difference between indefinite employment and fixed term contract?
* A term in the contract states:
    * Restraint of Trade agreement (Within the Western Cape)
    * Prohibits employees from having a direct interest in competitors
    * Prohibits sharing trade secrets or technologies
    * Three-year duration from end of agreement
    * Is this enforced (yes, if reasonable)
* Salary of 400 000
    * HR claims this requires overtime without pay

Note: Before a contract is signed, a company is invested in having vetted you
investment allows for negotiating the contract

* Contract is signed here, starts in January 2020
* in this case, Lee is a pacifist
    * What limitations can an employer set on an employees activities?
* Lee suffers from Type I Diabetes
    * It is under control
    * Lee occasionally suffers blurry vision and fatigue
    * When should this be disclosed? (Need not unless you desire accommodation)
    * Employer may require certain conditions be disclosed (within reason)
    * Questions may only be asked if relevant
* Lee has a side-job in network design outside of business hours
    * Employees owe _some_ deference to employers
    * (Again, within reason)
* Lee raises concerns about appointing unqualified persons to meet equity
    * Refuses to cooperate in this
    * Communicates with the ECSA
    * Considered conflict with the employer
    * When is whistleblowing allowed?
