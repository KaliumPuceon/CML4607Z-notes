Factual statement

Conclusion

## Fairness is the core principle of labour law
* Fairness is very subjective
* Different conclusions can be reached from the same principles
* Labour law is often solved backwards from the idea of fairness
* e.g. Requirements may be different for small and large businesses

# Modern South African Law
* Common Law is based on Roman-Dutch Law
* Common Law is drawn from court decisions
* English Law was later combined into common law
* Statutary Law is passed by Parliament
* Higher courts can make decisions that bind lower courts

# Back to labour Law

## Probation is allowed If Reasonable
* Useful to test if an employee is suitable
* Chosen as appropriate to the job
* Must be advised and assisted during this time

## Styles of bargaining
* Positional
    * Confrontational
    * Demand a need
* Interest-based
    * Convince that this is in an interest
    * Argument and compromise

## Restraint of Trade
* Limitations on working with/as competition
    * Access to trade secrets
    * Access to customers
* A valid restraint:
    * Is this enforceable?
        * Onus is on the employee to prove otherwise.
    * Are secrets really secrets?
    * Is the restraint reasonable?

### Challenging restraint of trade
* Requesting financial aid during interim
* Request NDA instead of Restraint

        * Ostensible Authority
