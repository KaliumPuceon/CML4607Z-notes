* Chose as appropriate to the job
* Must be advised and assisted during this time

## Styles of bargaining
* Positional
    * Confrontational
    * Demand a need
* Interest-based
    * Convince that this is in an interest
    * Argument and compromise

## Restraint of Trade
* Limitations on working with/as competition
    * Access to trade secrets
    * Access to customers
* A valid restraint:
    * Is this enforceable?
        * Onus is on the employee to prove otherwise.
    * Are secrets really secrets?
    * Is the restraint reasonable?
