# More Agency and Capacity

## Formation of a Valid Contract
1. Parties must have contractual capacity
2. Parties must have serious intention to contract
3. Parties must communicate intention to each other
4. Parties must understand the contract equally
    * Meeting of Minds
    * Both parties know what the contract entails
5. Agreement must be lawful
6. Performing the contract must be possible
7. Agreements must comply with formalities

A contract is founded on an Agreement:
* A valid offer + valid acceptance = valid contract
* Ideally a contract should require a yes/no answer to be agreed to
* Essential terms should be clear
    * e.g. in a sale, must include price and item fully defined
    * Non-essential terms may be left undefined if desired

* A contract must still exist when it is accepted
    * An offer may be ended by revocation, lapse or rejection

### Valid Acceptance
* Must be made by the person to whom the offer was addressed
* Acceptance must be made knowingly
* Acceptance must be clear and unconditional
    * silence *may* be acceptance in specific circumstance
* Acceptance must be communicated in the manner prescribed
    * Contract is concluded when and where the offerer learns of acceptance
* In term-by-term contracts, indvidual parts may be left unaccepted

## Contracts concluded without authority

### Liability of the Agent
* Agent can be held liable if:
    * Breached fiduciary duty
    * Misrepresented principal
    * Causes damages due to agreement

### Liability of the Principal


### Effects of Ratification
* Ratification occurs when agreement is upheld by authority anyways
* Entity agrees to be represented by agent post-facto

### Ratification not possible


### Estoppel

## Adverts under Common Law
* Adverts are not contracts
* Under CPA, suppliers have some other regulations
* Adverts which form agreements can serve as contracts
