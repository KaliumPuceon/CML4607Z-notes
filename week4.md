# Voidable Contracts

## Misrepresentation
* A false statement of fact made by one party to another before or when a
  contract is made
* Makes the agreement voidable by the offended party
* Not all false statements are misrepresentation
    * Opinion
    * Obvious exaggeration or other marketing (Puff)
    * Warranty
* Can be made by:
    * Express misrepresentation
    * By conduct
    * By silence
        * Through prior conduct
        * Through changed circumstances

### Remedy for Misrepresentation
* Rescind the agreement
* Remunerate Damages

## Duress
* Threat of evil
* Contract is voidable if:
    * Threat is made of "imminent or inevitable evil"
    * Threat is unlawful
        * _Contra Bonos Mores_: The morals of the general community
    * Threat is made by other party in contract
    * Threat induces agreement to the contract
    * There is a clear objection made to threats against property

## Undue Influence
* One person exercises influence over another
* Influence weakens the will of the other
* Person uses influence to make a contract that is:
    * To their detriment
    * Would not have been entered into without influence

## Illegality
* If the agreement is to be illegal, is it voidable?
    * Depends on legislation and/or interpretation
* Nature of the agreement itself
* Factors contributing to decision
    * Is the prohibition to raise money?
    * Would allowing the agreement to stand cause greater inconvenience
    * Would recognizing the agreement invalidate legislation
* Common Law Illegality: Acts that go against common morals
    * Agreement to do crime
    * Undermining the institution of marriage
    * Sexual immorality
    * Conflict with the constitution

# Example case
* Start-up ltd. has employed Thabo as a manager
    * Thabo is also in charge of finding new engineers
* Sarah is negotiating sale of an app to Start-up
    * All persons selling ideas must set out ideas in a form
    * Thabo will determine if the app is feasible but the company has final say
* An agreement is reached between Thabo and Sarah, with payment in 6 weeks
* The payment is not forthcoming, as the company has decided not to proceed
    * Claim there is no contract, as Thabo does not have authority

* Estoppel requires
    * Representation of principal to third party by agent with authority
    * 3rd party acted on the strength of that representation
    * 3rd party must have reasonable reliance on the misrepresentation
